The purpose of this analysis is to take a look at demographic trends and how they may relate to crime within Germany. A driver of this is due to the increase in news stories covering immigrant-instigated crime and nature of public discourse around immigration within the European Union.

I must say that I have an inherent pro-immigration bias and I will try my best to temper those in this analysis.

I am also by no means a professional; all statistics and conclusions from this analysis should be taken with a grain of salt. This has not been peer reviewed in an academic setting.
